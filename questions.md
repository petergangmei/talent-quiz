# Spiritual Gifts Survey Questions

## Directions

This is not a test, so there are no wrong answers. The Spiritual Gifts Survey consists of 80 statements. Some items reflect concrete actions, other items are descriptive traits, and still others are statements of belief.

- **Select the one response you feel best characterizes yourself** and place that number in the blank provided. Record your answer in the blank beside each item.
- **Do not spend too much time** on any one item. Remember, it is not a test. Usually your immediate response is best.
- Please give an answer for each item. Do not skip any items.
- Do not ask others how they are answering or how they think you should answer.
- Work at your own pace.

**Your response choices are:**
- **5** — Highly characteristic of me/definitely true for me
- **4** — Most of the time this would describe me/be true for me
- **3** — Frequently characteristic of me/true for me – about 50 percent of the time 
- **2** — Occasionally characteristic of me/true for me – about 25 percent of the time 
- **1** — Not at all characteristic of me/definitely untrue for me
